Metrics
========



## Install

Clone this repository on your Docker host, cd into directory and run compose up:

```bash

cd metrics

ADMIN_USER=admin ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin docker-compose up -d
```


* Prometheus (metrics database) `http://<host-ip>:9090`
* Prometheus-Pushgateway (push acceptor for ephemeral and batch jobs) `http://<host-ip>:9091`
* AlertManager (alerts management) `http://<host-ip>:9093`
* Grafana (visualize metrics) `http://<host-ip>:3000`
* NodeExporter (host metrics collector)
* cAdvisor (containers metrics collector)
* Caddy (reverse proxy and basic auth provider for prometheus and alertmanager)

## Setup Grafana

Navigate to `http://<host-ip>:3000` and login with user ***admin*** password ***admin***. You can change the credentials in the compose file or by supplying the `ADMIN_USER` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables on compose up. The config file can be added directly in grafana part like this
```
grafana:
  image: grafana/grafana:7.2.0
  env_file:
    - config

```
and the config file format should have this content
```
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=admin
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme
GF_USERS_ALLOW_SIGN_UP=false
```
If you want to change the password, you have to remove this entry, otherwise the change will not take effect
```
- grafana_data:/var/lib/grafana
```

Grafana is preconfigured with dashboards and Prometheus as the default data source:

* Name: Prometheus
* Type: Prometheus
* Url: http://prometheus:9090
* Access: proxy

***Docker Host Dashboard***


The Docker Host Dashboard shows key metrics for monitoring the resource usage of your server:

* Server uptime, CPU idle percent, number of CPU cores, available memory, swap and storage
* System load average graph, running and blocked by IO processes graph, interrupts graph
* CPU usage graph by mode (guest, idle, iowait, irq, nice, softirq, steal, system, user)
* Memory usage graph by distribution (used, free, buffers, cached)
* IO usage graph (read Bps, read Bps and IO time)
* Network usage graph by device (inbound Bps, Outbound Bps)
* Swap usage and activity graphs

For storage and particularly Free Storage graph, you have to specify the fstype in grafana graph request.
You can find it in `grafana/dashboards/docker_host.json`, at line 480 :

      "expr": "sum(node_filesystem_free_bytes{fstype=\"aufs\"})",

I work on ext4, so i need to change `aufs` to `ext4`.

You can find right value for your system in Prometheus `http://<host-ip>:9090` launching this request :

      node_filesystem_free_bytes

***Docker Containers Dashboard***


The Docker Containers Dashboard shows key metrics for monitoring running containers:

* Total containers CPU load, memory and storage usage
* Running containers graph, system load graph, IO usage graph
* Container CPU usage graph
* Container memory usage graph
* Container cached memory usage graph
* Container network inbound usage graph
* Container network outbound usage graph

Note that this dashboard doesn't show the containers that are part of the monitoring stack.

***Monitor Services Dashboard***


The Monitor Services Dashboard shows key metrics for monitoring the containers that make up the monitoring stack:

* Prometheus container uptime, monitoring stack total memory usage, Prometheus local storage memory chunks and series
* Container CPU usage graph
* Container memory usage graph
* Prometheus chunks to persist and persistence urgency graphs
* Prometheus chunks ops and checkpoint duration graphs
* Prometheus samples ingested rate, target scrapes and scrape duration graphs
* Prometheus HTTP requests graph
* Prometheus alerts graph

## Define alerts (pending) #Donttouch!!


You can modify the alert rules and reload them by making a HTTP POST call to Prometheus:

```
curl -X POST http://admin:admin@<host-ip>:9090/-/reload
```

***Monitoring services alerts***

Trigger an alert if any of the monitoring targets (node-exporter and cAdvisor) are down for more than 30 seconds:

```yaml
- alert: monitor_service_down
    expr: up == 0
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "Monitor service non-operational"
      description: "Service {{ $labels.instance }} is down."
```

***Docker Host alerts***

Trigger an alert if the Docker host CPU is under high load for more than 30 seconds:

```yaml
- alert: high_cpu_load
    expr: node_load1 > 1.5
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Server under high load"
      description: "Docker host is under high load, the avg load 1m is at {{ $value}}. Reported by instance {{ $labels.instance }} of job {{ $labels.job }}."
```

Modify the load threshold based on your CPU cores.

Trigger an alert if the Docker host memory is almost full:

```yaml
- alert: high_memory_load
    expr: (sum(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes) - sum(node_memory_MemFree_bytes + node_memory_Buffers_bytes + node_memory_Cached_bytes) ) / sum(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes) * 100 > 85
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Server memory is almost full"
      description: "Docker host memory usage is {{ humanize $value}}%. Reported by instance {{ $labels.instance }} of job {{ $labels.job }}."
```

Trigger an alert if the Docker host storage is almost full:

```yaml
- alert: high_storage_load
    expr: (node_filesystem_size_bytes{fstype="aufs"} - node_filesystem_free_bytes{fstype="aufs"}) / node_filesystem_size_bytes{fstype="aufs"}  * 100 > 85
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Server storage is almost full"
      description: "Docker host storage usage is {{ humanize $value}}%. Reported by instance {{ $labels.instance }} of job {{ $labels.job }}."
```

***Docker Containers alerts***

Trigger an alert if a container is down for more than 30 seconds:

```yaml
- alert: jenkins_down
    expr: absent(container_memory_usage_bytes{name="jenkins"})
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "Jenkins down"
      description: "Jenkins container is down for more than 30 seconds."
```

Trigger an alert if a container is using more than 10% of total CPU cores for more than 30 seconds:

```yaml
- alert: jenkins_high_cpu
    expr: sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{name="jenkins"}[1m])) / count(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="system"}) * 100 > 10
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Jenkins high CPU usage"
      description: "Jenkins CPU usage is {{ humanize $value}}%."
```

Trigger an alert if a container is using more than 1.2GB of RAM for more than 30 seconds:

```yaml
- alert: jenkins_high_memory
    expr: sum(container_memory_usage_bytes{name="jenkins"}) > 1200000000
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Jenkins high memory usage"
      description: "Jenkins memory consumption is at {{ humanize $value}}."
```

## Setup alerting (pending)

The AlertManager service is responsible for handling alerts sent by Prometheus server.
AlertManager can send notifications via email, Pushover, Slack, HipChat or any other system that exposes a webhook interface.

You can view and silence notifications by accessing `http://<host-ip>:9093`.

The notification receivers can be configured in [alertmanager/config.yml](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/blob/master/alertmanager/config.yml) file.


## Sending metrics to the Pushgateway (pending)

The [pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway) is used to collect data from batch jobs or from services.

To push data, simply execute:

    echo "some_metric 3.14" | curl --data-binary @- http://user:password@localhost:9091/metrics/job/some_job

Please replace the `user:password` part with your user and password set in the initial configuration (default: `admin:admin`).
